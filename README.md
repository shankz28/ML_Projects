Loan Prediction Project
This repository contains my Loan Prediction project, which aims to predict the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on various features such as credit history, income, loan amount, etc. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and I have referred to the project work of Mario Ceasar for guidance and inspiration.

Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan will be approved or not. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using various classification algorithms.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
Model Building: Training and evaluating multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

Results:
The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics and further optimized for better accuracy.
