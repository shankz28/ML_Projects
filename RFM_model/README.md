**RFM Model Project**

This repository contains my RFM Model project, which aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis framework. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Karina, a Data Scientist, and YouTuber with a background in finance turned data professional. I have also referred to her project work for guidance and inspiration.
