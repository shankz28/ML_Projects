RFM Model Project

This repository contains my RFM Model project, which aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis framework. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or proprietary datasets], and I have referred to the project work of [relevant references or mentors] for guidance and inspiration.
